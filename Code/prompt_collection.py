"""
Please show me
1. the steps of semiconductor manufacturing,
2. in which of these x-rays are used and why
2.a today and 2.b probably in the future
which companies are serving the market
which companies are buying x-eay solutions, today and potentially in the future?
and 3. which other inspection technologies are used and at which steps.
4. what else regarding semiconductor market could be from ineterest for a company developing and selling x-ray sources?
